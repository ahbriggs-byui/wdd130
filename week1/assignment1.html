    <h2>(Bagel)</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Abigail and I am the oldest child of Bro. Briggs. :D I am a junior and a nursing major but I like computers as well... Hense why I am taking this class. I did color guard with my high school for 6 years and marched 1 year at Utah State Univeristy. In my spare time I really like playing video games and reading. I like being outside when the sun is not burning me alive. Oh and last year my roommate got me addicted to pokemon cards so I enjoy collecting those now I guess. XD</p>
